# Temporary Bypass Mode

The plugin provides a temporary bypass to disable resource-intensive features.

- The `rtbcb_disable_heavy_features` option skips:
    - AI enrichment
    - Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
    - Intelligent recommendations

This bypass is also activated when **Fast Mode** is enabled.

Use this mode to troubleshoot or reduce API usage. Remember to re-enable full functionality when advanced analysis is needed.
