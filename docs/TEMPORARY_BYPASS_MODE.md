# Temporary Bypass Mode

The plugin can temporarily skip heavy features like AI enrichment, RAG searches, and
intelligent recommendations. This is useful during service interruptions or when
fast ROI-only results are sufficient.

- Enable **Disable Heavy Features** from the plugin settings to bypass these steps.
- The existing **Fast Mode** option also bypasses heavy features.
- An admin notice appears while the bypass is active.
- Disable the option to restore full functionality.

For more details see the settings page in your WordPress dashboard.
