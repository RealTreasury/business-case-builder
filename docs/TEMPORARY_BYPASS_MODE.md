# Temporary Bypass Mode

The plugin can temporarily disable heavy AI features when certain services are unavailable or when you
want faster processing.

- Enable the **Disable Heavy Features** option on the plugin's settings page to bypass AI enrichment,
    RAG searches, and intelligent recommendations.
- When enabled, comprehensive reports use fallback logic and a notice is shown in the WordPress admin.
- Fast Mode also bypasses these features automatically.

To re-enable full functionality, uncheck the setting and save. The notice will disappear after the next
page load.
