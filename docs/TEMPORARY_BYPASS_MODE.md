# Temporary Bypass Mode

The plugin includes a global option to disable heavy AI features when needed.

- Set the **Disable Heavy Features** option in the settings to skip AI enrichment, RAG, and intelligent recommendations.
- Fast Mode also bypasses these components.
- A warning appears in the admin area while the bypass is active.

Use this mode to troubleshoot or reduce resource usage, then reâ€‘enable the features for full analysis.
