# Bypass Mode

When heavy features are unavailable or need to be skipped, the plugin can fall back to a lighter workflow.

- Set the `rtbcb_disable_heavy_features` option to `1` to bypass AI enrichment, RAG, and intelligent recommendations.
- Enabling Fast Mode also triggers the bypass.
- Administrators see a warning notice while the bypass is active.

Remove the option or disable Fast Mode to restore full functionality.
