## Code Architecture

### Capability System
The plugin implements a sophisticated capability system that adapts to different WordPress environments:

**Self-hosted WordPress**:
- Primary: `manage_options`
- Fallback: `edit_pages` → `edit_posts` → `read`

**WordPress.com**:
- Primary: `edit_pages`
- Fallback: `edit_posts` → `read`

### Admin Menu Registration
```php
// In admin/classes/Admin.php
public function register_admin_menu() {
    $capability = $this->get_admin_capability();
    
    add_menu_page(
        __( 'Business Case Builder', 'rtbcb' ),
        __( 'Real Treasury', 'rtbcb' ),
        $capability,  // Dynamic capability
        'rtbcb-dashboard',
        [ $this, 'render_dashboard_page' ],
        'dashicons-chart-line',
        30
    );
}
```

### WordPress.com Detection
```php
// In inc/utils/helpers.php
function rtbcb_is_wordpress_com() {
    if ( defined( 'IS_WPCOM' ) && IS_WPCOM ) return true;
    if ( defined( 'WPCOM_VIP' ) && WPCOM_VIP ) return true;
    if ( function_exists( 'wpcom_vip_file_get_contents' ) ) return true;
    
    $server_name = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] ?? '';
    if ( strpos( $server_name, '.wordpress.com' ) !== false ) return true;
    
    return false;
}
```

1. ✅ **Admin Menu Visibility**: Dynamic capability system ensures menu appears for appropriate user roles across all WordPress environments
2. ✅ **PHP 8.3 Compatibility**: All code is fully compatible with PHP 8.3, using modern syntax patterns
