## üìã Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- WordPress 5.0 or higher
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for business case generation)

### Step 1: Plugin Installation
1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/real-treasury-business-case-builder/`
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin
3. Navigate to **Real Treasury ‚Üí Settings** in your admin dashboard

### Step 2: Configure OpenAI Integration
1. Sign up for an OpenAI API account at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Generate an API key in your OpenAI dashboard
3. Enter the API key in **Real Treasury ‚Üí Settings**
4. Configure your preferred models:
   - **Mini Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (for efficiency)
   - **Premium Model**: `gpt-4o` (for complex requests)
   - **Embedding Model**: `text-embedding-3-small` (for RAG)

### Step 3: Configure Database Tables
The plugin automatically creates required database tables on activation:
- `wp_rtbcb_leads` - Lead tracking and analytics
- `wp_rtbcb_rag_index` - Retrieval-augmented generation index

### Step 4: Display the Form
Add the shortcode to any page or post:
```
[rt_business_case_builder]
```

**Advanced Shortcode Options:**
```
[rt_business_case_builder
   title="Custom Title"
   subtitle="Custom Description"
   style="modern"]
```

## üìÑ HTML Reports

- Reports are rendered server-side using `templates/report-template.php`.
- After form submission, `RTBCB_Router` returns the report HTML via AJAX as `report_html`.
- `public/js/rtbcb.js` injects this HTML into `#rtbcb-report-container` for immediate viewing.
- Reports are not saved as files; only lead metadata is stored in the database.
- Users can save or print the report directly from their browser if needed.

);
```

### API Integration

**OpenAI Models Used:**
- **GPT-4o-mini**: Fast responses for simple categorization
- **GPT-4o**: Complex business case generation
- **text-embedding-3-small**: RAG search and similarity matching

**Intelligent Model Routing:**
The system automatically selects the appropriate model based on:
- Request complexity (number of pain points, company size)
- Context requirements (amount of RAG data needed)
- Performance requirements (speed vs. quality trade-offs)

## üìä ROI Calculation Methodology

### Core Assumptions
- **Labor Cost**: $100/hour (fully loaded)
- **Efficiency Gains**: 20-40% reduction in manual tasks
- **Error Reduction**: 20-30% decrease in costly mistakes
- **Bank Fee Optimization**: 5-12% reduction through better positioning

### Calculation Components

**1. Labor Cost Savings**
```
Annual Savings = (Weekly Hours Saved √ó 52 weeks √ó $100/hour)
Efficiency Rate = 30% ¬± 6% (scenario dependent)
```

**2. Bank Fee Reduction**
```
Annual Savings = (Number of Banks √ó $15,000 baseline √ó 8% reduction rate)
```

**3. Error Prevention Value**
```
Annual Value = Company Size Factor √ó Error Cost Baseline √ó 25% reduction
Size Factors: <$50M=$25k, $50M-$500M=$75k, $500M-$2B=$200k, >$2B=$500k
```

### Scenario Modeling
- **Conservative (80% confidence)**: 80% of base case assumptions
- **Base Case (100% confidence)**: Industry benchmark assumptions
- **Optimistic (120% confidence)**: 120% of base case assumptions

## üé® Customization Options

### Styling and Branding
The plugin includes CSS custom properties for easy theming:
```css
:root {
    --primary-purple: #7216f4;
    --primary-purple-light: #a78bfa;
    --secondary-purple: #8f47f6;
    --light-purple: #c77dff;
    --dark-text: #281345;
    --gray-text: #4b5563;
    --neutral-200: #e5e7eb;
    --success-green: #10b981;
}
```

### Custom Templates
Override templates by creating files in your theme:
```
/wp-content/themes/your-theme/rtbcb/business-case-form.php
/wp-content/themes/your-theme/rtbcb/report-template.php
```

### Hooks and Filters
```php
// Modify ROI assumptions
add_filter('rtbcb_roi_assumptions', function($assumptions) {
    $assumptions['labor_cost_per_hour'] = 120;
    return $assumptions;
});

// Customize category scoring
add_filter('rtbcb_category_scores', function($scores, $inputs) {
    // Custom scoring logic
    return $scores;
}, 10, 2);

```

## üìà Analytics and Reporting

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Lead Volume**: Daily, weekly, monthly submissions
- **Category Distribution**: Which solutions are most commonly recommended
- **Company Segmentation**: Enterprise vs. SMB lead breakdown
- **ROI Trends**: Average projected returns over time
- **Geographic Analysis**: Lead sources by location (IP-based)
- **Conversion Funnels**: Form completion rates by step

### Export Capabilities
- **CSV Export**: Complete lead data with filters
- **Date Range Filtering**: Custom time periods
- **UTM Attribution**: Marketing campaign performance
- **ROI Benchmarking**: Industry comparison data

## üîí Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Email Encryption**: Sensitive data stored with encryption
- **GDPR Compliance**: Built-in consent mechanisms
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions

### Security Features
- **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX requests protected
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive data validation
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Prepared statements throughout
- **XSS Prevention**: All output properly escaped

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

### Automated Tests
The plugin includes integration tests for all major components. These can be run from the settings page via the **Run Diagnostics** button or programmatically:
```php
// Run integration tests
$results = RTBCB_Tests::run_integration_tests();
```

### Runtime Debugging
For manual verification during development, `debug_ajax_handler()` includes runtime checks for common setup issues:

- **Leads Table Test**
  ```php
  global $wpdb;
  $wpdb->get_results( "SHOW TABLES LIKE '{$wpdb->prefix}rtbcb_leads'" );
  ```
  Use this query to confirm the `rtbcb_leads` table exists.

- **Missing API Key Logging**
  ```php
  if ( '' === get_option( 'rtbcb_openai_api_key' ) ) {
      error_log( 'rtbcb_openai_api_key option is empty' );
  }
  ```
  This logs a warning when the OpenAI API key is not set.

`debug_ajax_handler()` executes these checks automatically for runtime verification.

### Performance Monitoring
- **Database Query Optimization**: Indexed tables for fast searches
- **Caching Integration**: Compatible with WordPress caching plugins
- **Asset Optimization**: Minified CSS/JS for production
- **Lazy Loading**: Assets only loaded when shortcode is present

## üìû Support and Documentation

### Getting Help
1. **Plugin Documentation**: Complete feature documentation in `/docs/`
2. **WordPress Support Forums**: Community support and troubleshooting
3. **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
4. **Real Treasury Support**: Priority support for enterprise users

### Common Issues

**Q: OpenAI API calls return authentication errors**
A: Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient credits in your OpenAI account.

**Q: Charts not displaying in analytics**
A: The analytics dashboard relies on Chart.js for visualizations. The plugin bundles this library locally to avoid ad blockers, but strict privacy extensions may still block it. Ensure your browser allows the plugin's scripts so charts can render correctly.

**Q: Lead data not saving**
A: Check database permissions and ensure tables were created during plugin activation.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter `Unchecked runtime.lastError` messages, they typically originate from WordPress.com scripts or browser extensions. Allow third-party cookies or disable the offending extension to resolve the issue.

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Use object caching for repeated calculations
- **CDN Integration**: Host assets on CDN for faster loading
- **Database Optimization**: Regular cleanup of old lead data
- **API Rate Limiting**: Built-in throttling for OpenAI requests

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap and Future Features

### Version 2.2 (Coming Soon)
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global users
- **Advanced Integrations**: Salesforce, HubSpot, and CRM connectivity
- **White-label Options**: Complete branding customization
- **API Endpoints**: REST API for external integrations

### Version 2.3 (Planned)
- **Machine Learning**: Improved recommendation accuracy
